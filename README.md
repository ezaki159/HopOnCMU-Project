# HopOnCMU

This repository contains an implementation of the HopOnCMU project, for the 2017/2018 **Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing** course
at **Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico**.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a distributed mobile Android application named HopOnCMU, which aims to provide tourism quizzes on hop-on-hop-off buses. HopOnCMU will allow users to answer quizzes about monuments that they visit on hop-on-hop-off tours and to compete with other users for prizes given out at the end of the touring day to those with the most correct answers.
The considerations is that in this context users might only have internet access on the monuments they visit.
